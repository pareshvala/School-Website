			<h1>Welcome to <strong>Nachiketa Vidya Sankul</strong></h1>
			<hr>
			<p>'Nand Kishor', a public charitable trust was established in the year 2015, inspiring, encouraging foundations till now 'we' inculcated the values and morals as a social participation and added the flavors of cultural activities, colors of festivals and much of the drops of 'Nectar' to develop and hold the pillars of Nand Kishor's foundation.</p>

			<p>Thereafter the concept of the Nachiketa Vidhya Sanku was brought into existence in the year 2016 with pre-primary classes and was taken to the great heights. Today it isn't just the sleek design that makes the institute so satisfying but it's the medium at the foremost center to provide educational, social and moral qualities. Each and every field of institution from nursery to higher Secondary sections of both English and Gujarati Mediums along with GSEB have furnished equally at its impressive pinnacles. Our institution is always in the motion of aiming the system of construction of every child from its domain to objective, so as to develop and inculcate values towards the society. Everyone, whoever is connected with constructive attitude is appreciable for every achievement and for the better future of our students.</p>

			<p>Besides education, sports activities even emphasize on cultural and social performances with co-ordination of support from society and other organizations. The main aim behind such activities is to implement life skills like risk-taking, decision making etc. to raise the child's potentialities and make the self-reliant. Our institute with every member and authoritative person will always provide the drops of pastille which will glitter with glimming brightness.</p>

			<p>Our main observation and objectives of domain were to bring the taste of education and devote ourselves in charity work like blood donation, facilitating medical aids for needy, controlling environmental disturbances etc. still one step ahead we supported the victims of 'Tsunami', Flood with support to donations, help ages for orphanage schools and old age homes as a part of charity work. And hereafter too, will be eager to guide economy and social activities with a touch to humanity. We also have future plans of establishing orphanages and center for first aid medical facilities to the outpatient. This activity inculcates values like caring and sharing and make the students the best citizens of tomorrow.</p>
